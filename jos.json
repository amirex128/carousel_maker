[{"Id":1,"Title":"SQL Databases","Body":"SQL databases use structured query language for defining and manipulating data. They are table-based, ideal for complex queries and transactions. Popular examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.","Example":"MySQL, PostgreSQL","HashTag":"#SQL","Question":"What are SQL databases best for?","Answer":"SQL databases are best for complex queries and transactions."},{"Id":2,"Title":"NoSQL Databases","Body":"NoSQL databases are designed for distributed data stores with large-scale data needs. They are schema-less and support various data models like document, key-value, and graph.","Example":"MongoDB, Cassandra","HashTag":"#NoSQL","Question":"What types of data models do NoSQL databases support?","Answer":"NoSQL databases support document, key-value, and graph data models."},{"Id":3,"Title":"Key-Value Databases","Body":"Key-value databases store data as a collection of key-value pairs. They are highly efficient for simple lookups and are often used for caching and real-time applications.","Example":"Redis, DynamoDB","HashTag":"#KeyValueDB","Question":"What are key-value databases used for?","Answer":"Key-value databases are used for caching and real-time applications."},{"Id":4,"Title":"Document Databases","Body":"Document databases store data in JSON-like documents. They are flexible and ideal for applications needing a dynamic schema. Examples include MongoDB and CouchDB.","Example":"MongoDB, CouchDB","HashTag":"#DocumentDB","Question":"What format do document databases use?","Answer":"Document databases use JSON-like documents."},{"Id":5,"Title":"Column-Family Databases","Body":"Column-family databases organize data into columns and rows. They are optimized for read and write performance, making them suitable for big data applications.","Example":"Cassandra, HBase","HashTag":"#ColumnFamilyDB","Question":"For what applications are column-family databases optimized?","Answer":"Column-family databases are optimized for big data applications."},{"Id":6,"Title":"Graph Databases","Body":"Graph databases use graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to represent data. They excel in handling relationships and are used in social networks, recommendation engines, and fraud detection.","Example":"Neo4j, OrientDB","HashTag":"#GraphDB","Question":"What applications benefit most from graph databases?","Answer":"Applications like social networks and recommendation engines benefit most."},{"Id":7,"Title":"Time-Series Databases","Body":"Time-series databases are optimized for time-stamped or time-series data. They are used in applications like IoT, finance, and monitoring systems where tracking changes over time is crucial.","Example":"InfluxDB, TimescaleDB","HashTag":"#TimeSeriesDB","Question":"What type of data do time-series databases handle?","Answer":"Time-series databases handle time-stamped or time-series data."}]
